# fortigate_exporter

![Go](https://github.com/bluecmd/fortigate_exporter/workflows/Go/badge.svg)

Prometheus exporter for Fortigate firewalls.

## Usage

Example:

```
./fortigate_exporter -auth-file ~/fortigate-key.yaml
```

Where `~/fortigate-key.yaml` contains pairs of Fortigate targets and API keys in the following format:

```
"https://my-fortigate":
  token: api-key-goes-here
"https://my-other-fortigate:8443":
  token: api-key-goes-here
```

NOTE: Currently only token authentication is supported. Fortigate does not allow usage of tokens on non-HTTPS connections,
which means that currently you need HTTPS to be configured properly.

To probe a Fortigate, do something like `curl 'localhost:9710/probe?target=https://my-fortigate'`
